# Project Description

This project is for practicing FLET in Python. It is based on a YouTube video: [link](https://youtu.be/nFJ3Ba7aOdg).

## Additional Functionality

I added one more function:

- Each button from the header corresponds to a different region:
  - RED = Kanto (1 - 151)
  - YELLOW = Johto (152 - 251)
  - GREEN = Hoenn (252 - 386)

## Additional Information

I also added more information to display. Using another endpoint from the PokeAPI ([link](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/1/)), we can retrieve the Pokedex description.
